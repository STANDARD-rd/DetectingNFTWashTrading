# DetectingNFTWashTrading
The purpose of this project is to detect NFT wash trading.

## What is NFT Wash Trading ?
NFT wash trading is the act of staging NFT transactions to incite purchases. A number of collaborators repeatedly trade an NFT among themselves, attracting attention to the NFT and increasing the apparent value of the NFT, which in turn increases the willingness to buy.

## About our project
The purpose of this project is to develop software to detect the above NFT wash trading. We hope that this software will help detect contamination of the NFT market.
